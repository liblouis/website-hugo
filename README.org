* What
A very simple website for liblouis based on [[https://gohugo.io/][hugo]] and the [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/][book theme]].
Essentially it should work pretty much like the existing site.

* Why
- Simple look :: I wanted a very simple look that handles
  documentation well. The book theme provides this.
- Few dependencies :: I've been burned by the [[https://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] upgrade process
  in the past. That's why I prefer a static site builder that comes as
  a single binary like hugo.

* Build
#+begin_example
hugo serve
#+end_example
