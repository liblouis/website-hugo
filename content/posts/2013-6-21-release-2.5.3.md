## New features

### New Braille tables

* Korean grade 1 and grade 2 thanks to Joseph Lee
* U.K. English 8 dot computer braille table thanks to David Reynolds
* New Russian literary and computer braille tables thanks to Igor B. Poretsky. These replace the older Russian tables which are left for backwards compatibility.
* New hyphenation dictionary for Russian thanks to Igor B. Poretsky.
* Updated hyphenation tables for the Norwegian language (nynorsk and bokmål) thanks to Lars Bjørndal.
* New hyphenation dictionary for Esperanto thanks to Aaron Cannon.
* New Esperanto grade 1 table, using the x system for accented letters, thanks to Aaron Cannon.

### runHarness.py:

Accept filename globs on the commandline to run specific harness files. In tests/harness, one can do `make <filename>` or `make runall`. Removed from `make check` because these checks are checking the validity of our tables, rather than validity of the code.

## Braille Table Improvements

* `da-dk-g2.ctb`, mostly rewritten to use nocross and hyphenation table.
* Most tables: removed the default collapse whitespace statements, if you need to compress whitespace, consider adding compress.ctb to the list of tables when processing.
* Corrections to Unified English Braille Code (Grade 1 and 2), thanks to Joseph Lee
* Corrections to apostrophes in the Computer Spanish 8 dots Braille table (`Es-Es-G0.utb`). Thanks to Juan C. Buno.
* Corrections for double angle quotation marks and emphasis marks in the Norwegian Grade 0 Braille Table. Thanks to Knut Arne Bjørndal.
* Fixes for a minor problem regarding the noletsign in Norwegian contracted braille. Thanks to Lars Bjørndal.
* Corrections to the Italian table thanks to Igor B. Poretsky.
* Corrections to the Hungarian grade 1 table thanks to Hammer Attila
* Corrections to English, U.S. Grade 2 (ABAE) table. Thanks to Ken Perry for reporting the bug and John J. Boyer for fixing it.
* Further reorganization of the tables to remove duplication. Move litdigit opcode common parts and include where needed.
* Removed obsolete en-us-g1.utb, which has been replaced by `en-us-g1.ctb`.
* Added dictionary harness tests for: `en-ueb-g2.ctb`, `en-us-g2.ctb`.
* Corrections to Nemeth character definitions thanks to Neil Soiffer.
* Corrections to the Esperanto table thanks to Aaron Cannon.

## Bug Fixes

* Cursor position calculation is now based on the same code that calculates inpos and outpos. This probably solves a number of bugs.
* Fix nocross opcode processing.
* Fix several buffer over/under runs in `lou_translateString.c:hyphenate`.
* Fix the '=' problem, i.e. fix `inputPositions` calculation for the case where the equals sign is used as the dots operand. Thanks to Bert Frees
* Fix a bug when resizing a table. Previously not all references to this table were updated.

## Backwards incompatible changes

The feature that allowed a mapping between language code and Braille table was removed as it contained a out-of-bounds access bug, was never documented and probably never used. Thanks to Peter Nilsson Lundblad and Jeremy Roman for analyzing this problem and providing a patch.
