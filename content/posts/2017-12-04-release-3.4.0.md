title: Liblouis Release 3.4.0
categories: Liblouis
date: 2017-12-04

This release brings together a lot of work by lots of different people. Probably the most prominent fix is the work on output positions by Bue and Bert. NVDA should benefit from this. Then there are new and massively improved tables like the Lithuanian 6-dot table by Rimas or the improved back-translation for French by Michel and André-Abush to name just a few. There are too many contributors to name them here, thanks to them all.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [the list of closed issues](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/14?closed=1).

## New features

- Add support for `inputPos` and `outputPos` checking in `lou_checkyaml` thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen. See the [manual](/documentation/liblouis.html#lou_005fcheckyaml) for details and examples.


## Bug fixes

- output positions (`outputPos`) are now calculated based on input positions (`inputPos`) thanks to Bert Frees. This avoids a whole class of bugs that previously plagued the output positions. This fix also obviates the need for the `pass1Only` flag. See below for the [deprecation notice](#deprecation-notice).
