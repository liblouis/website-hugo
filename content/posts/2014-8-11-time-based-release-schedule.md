In the irc meeting the maintainer team agreed to move to a time based release schedule. We will release four times a year namely always on Monday of ISO week 10, 23, 36 and 49. 

Hence the next release will be on September 1, 2014, followed by December 1, 2014, March 2, 2015, June 1, 2015, August 31, 2015, November 30, 2015 and so forth.

## What will be in the next release?

Generally whatever is ready will be included in the release. For the next release have a look at the pending [pull requests](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/pulls). 

In particular there are a number of table improvements that we would like to include. For table improvements we also want test data to ensure quality. So if you want your table included in the release please provide test data.

## Is this coordinated with NVDA, Orca, etc?

Yes, we try to accommodate the release schedule of other projects. Picking dates however is always a balancing act.
