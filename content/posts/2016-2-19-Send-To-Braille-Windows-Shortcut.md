[Send To Braille](http://tech.aph.org/lt) is a tool published by
[APH](http://www.aph.org) to create a quick and dirty braille file
using Liblouis and [Pandoc](http://www.pandoc.org) on Windows. It adds
a shortcut to your Send To folder, so you can point at a file, right
click and pick Send To, then pick Braille. It creates a braille
version of the file with minimal formatting in the same folder with
`.brl` appended to the end of the original file's name. It keeps the
original extension to help you see the original file's source, so if
you translate `test.doc`, you end up with `test.doc.brl`. Please visit
the [project page](http://tech.aph.org/lt) for more information and
downloads.
