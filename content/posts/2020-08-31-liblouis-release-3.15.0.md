This release contains updates to the Afrikaans, Malayalam, Malay, Israeli, classical English and Portuguese tables. It also contains a new table for Coptic thanks to first-time contributor Ibraam Nasif. Behind the scenes there have been major changes to the cross-compilation tool-chain that will finally allow us to ship pre-built windows binaries that contain `lou_checkyaml.exe`.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [the list of closed issues](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/25?closed=1).

Invisible changes
-----------------

-   Major rework of the cross-compilation tool-chain. There are now Docker images that should allow for local builds of binaries for 32 and 64 bit. These include the libyaml library so the binaries contain `lou_checkyaml.exe`. This will allow table creators to test their changes locally under windows.
