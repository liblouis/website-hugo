Aside from the usual improvements to Braille tables this release focuses on improving the internal infrastructure. Numerous bugs have been fixed, the CI infrastructure also checks mingw builds now and MSVC compatibility has been massively improved. For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [the list of closed issues](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/10?closed=1).
