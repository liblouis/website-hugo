## Deprecation notice

-   The `mode` parameter in `lou_dotsToChar` never had any effect and is now deprecated.
-   In 2012 a new way to specify the test and action part in context and multipass opcodes was introduced. It was never documented and has no known usage in the wild. However it opens up the attack surface to the table parsing code. Therefore it is deprecated and will be removed in the next release.
