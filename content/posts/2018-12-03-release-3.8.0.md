The major focus of this release is on braille table updates. There are major updates to German, Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, Dutch, Czech, Latvian, Spanish and Ethiopic. Some of these new tables have only been possible because Bert Frees fixed some nasty long standing bugs behind the scene. Also there is the usual assortment of code improvements and cleanups.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [the list of closed issues](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/18?closed=1).
