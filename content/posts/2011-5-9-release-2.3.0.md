This release contains support for many more languages than before (Swedish, Kurdish, Ethiopic, Serbian, many Indian languages). The search path for tables is now a list of paths. Finally there is the usual assortment of bug fixes.

## New features

### Multiple table search path

The environment variable `LOUIS_TABLEPATH` can now contain a list of paths (separated by commas) where liblouis should look for tables. This allows the user to keep local tables.

### New `--quiet` option for `lou_checktable`

`lou_checktable` writes to stderr even in the case of success. This can now be suppressed with the new option `--quiet`.

### New Swedish table

A new table for Swedish braille has been provided by Samuel Thibault.

### New table for Sorani (Kurdish)

A new table for Sorani (Kurdish) Braille has been donated by Peter Engström from Index Braille

### New table for Ethiopic

A new table for Ethiopic Braille has been donated by Tamru E. Belay PH.D from Adaptive Technology Center for the Blind (ATCB)

### New table for Serbian

A new table for Serbian Braille has been donated by Peter Engström from Index Braille
