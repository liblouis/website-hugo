This release stands in the tradition of small incremental improvements that make it another fine and solid release. Andrey Yakuboy put in a lot of work to improve Russian literary and computer braille. He also provided a new table for Belarusian uncontracted and computer braille. Aside from that there are numerous improvements in Braille tables such as French, Polish and Urdu. The documentation has been improved as has the table meta marking the tables whether they are geared towards forward or backwards translation. I\'d like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [the list of closed issues](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/27?closed=1).
