While initially planned as mainly a bug fix release this release contains some notable new features: There is a new tool to trace which rules have been used to perform a translation. Also along with other new tables the long awaited table for UEB is finally here.

## New features

### New tool to trace rule application

There is a new tool (`lou_trace`) which helps to trace which rules have been used to perform a Braille translation. This is helpful for writing Braille tables. See the documentation for more information.

* UEB grade 1 and 2, thanks to Joseph Lee. These tables replace the old UEB tables (`UEBC-g1.utb` and `UEBC-g2.ctb`).

## Bug Fixes
