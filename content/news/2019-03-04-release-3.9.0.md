This release has seen a tremendous amount of work by Bert Frees. He was instrumental in pushing the improvements for Latvian, Norwegian and Slovenian. But most prominently he pushed the big change for space and control character handling through the door. These characters are now no longer hard coded in liblouis. This should solve a few long standing issues. Other than that there is the usual assortment of code improvements and cleanups.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [the list of closed issues](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/19?closed=1).

## New features

-   None

## Bug fixes

-   Fix a problem in the callback registration in the Python bindings thanks to Leonard de Ruijter.
-   Fixed memory leaks created by block scope compound literals thanks to Martin Gieseking.
-   The hard coded rules dealing with white space have been replaced with a normal table that is included in all tables. This fixes a number of bugs to do with space and control characters. This (big) change has been brewing for a couple of releases and has finally landed. Thanks to Christian Egli and Bert Frees.


## Braille table improvements

-   Major extension of the German 8 dot computer braille table thanks to Ali-Riza Ciftcioglu. For example the Euro sign or quote characters are finally defined.
-   Fix a few issues with Hungarian grade1 and grade2 Braille thanks to Attila Hammer.
-   Various improvements to Norwegian thanks to Lars Bjørndal, Jostein Austvik Jacobsen, Ammar Usama and Bert Frees.
-   Updates to Bopomofo-based Chinese Braille thanks to Sponge Jhan: Improved Braille representation of Chinese characters, and rewritten Kana rules using multipass statements.
-   Implement the new Slovenian Braille standard thanks to Robert Merič and Bert Frees.
-   Updates to Latvian Grade 1 Braille thanks to Artis Raugulis and Bert Frees.
-   Fixes to English, U.S. Grade 2 (ABAE) thanks to jdatray.


## Other changes

-   Don't search for tables in `/usr/local/share/liblouis/tables` (or the Windows equivalent) if `LOUIS_TABLEPATH` is set.
-   The log levels in `liblouis.h` are no longer exposed as `LOG_FOO` but instead are now prefixed. So `LOG_WARN` becomes `LOU_LOG_WARN` for example to issue a warning from a C program using liblouis. The actual values remain the same, so the ABI remains stable.


## Deprecation notice

-   The `locale` opcode was never implemented and was just silently ignored. It is now removed from the tables and and a warning will be issued if it is found in a table.
