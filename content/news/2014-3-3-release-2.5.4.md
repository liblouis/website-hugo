This release contains nine months worth of braille table improvements for example for Danish, UEB, en-us, Nemeth, Bulgarian, Slovenian and many more. Also there are fixes to the core for table path resolving and back-translation.

## New features

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed ENDSEGMENT indicator in computer Braille thanks to John Boyer.
* Emphasized words should now be contracted consistently thanks to John Boyer.
* Fixed several problems with back-translation. A slash within a number and strings such as 5-inch-diameter and 25-year-old-man should now back-translate correctly. Thanks to John Boyer.
* Fixed a problem with syllable opcode. Thanks to John Boyer.
* Fix warnings with gcc 4.8.2. Thanks to Peter Lundblad.
* When a table is specified with an absolute or relative path, the "includes" in that table will now work as expected, meaning files in the same directory will be found.
